## Goal

### Application for the business:

A virtual interviewer which allows recruiters to perform automated first-round interviews on a near limitless number of candidates concurrently.  This allows recruiters to give each candidate a chance rather than pass by candidates simply due to lack of available time. 

### Application for the job hunter:

Practice on challenging job interviews as if it was with a real person.  Get live analysis and feedback to improve!
